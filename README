Let's translate these subs into as many languages as is possible.  Just copy the en.srt, translate, let me know you've done it, and I'll give you commit access to the repository.

If you want to make changes to the English script, fork away ;)

I recommend VLC for viewing these subtitles.

Once you've cloned the repository you'll need to download the video file that goes along with these subtitles.

Just add it to the folder... but don't ever add it to the repository... it's too big for my free GitHub account.
