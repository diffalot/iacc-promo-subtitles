Let's translate these subs into as many languages as is possible.  Just copy the en.srt, translate, let me know you've done it, and I'll give you commit access to the repository.

If you want to make changes to the English script, fork away ;)

I recommend VLC for viewing these subtitles.

Once you've cloned the repository you'll need to download the video file that goes along with these subtitles.  

http://papyromancer.s3.amazonaws.com/IACC-Promo.m4v

Just add it to the folder... but don't ever add it to the repository... it's too big for my free GitHub account.

To view the current English render with subtitles burned in visit http://papyromancer.net/posts/7 .

Don't worry if you don't know how to use Git, you can download the English subtitles here: <http://papyromancer.s3.amazonaws.com/IACC-Promo.EN.srt> and when you've completed a translation, just send me a text file of the translation as an attachment to an email addressed to papyromancer@papyromancer.net. I will use FFmpegX <http://www.ffmpegx.com/> and mencoder <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/> to burn the titles onto the video.

Phone me at (601) 255-4393 or email papyromancer@papyromancer.net if you need any assistance assisting me ;)

If you help translate these subtitles a combined donation of $1500 will be split between The Internet Archive and Creative Commons in the names of all the translators.
