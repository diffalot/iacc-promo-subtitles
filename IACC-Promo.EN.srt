1
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:08,691
Great Grandpa, what are you watching?

2
00:00:10,404 --> 00:00:14,936
I'm studying the foundations of our Bitchun Society.

3
00:00:18,813 --> 00:00:24,498
People dressed so funny then.  Why would 
anyone wear such a funny thing on their head?

4
00:00:24,479 --> 00:00:26,353
Ha, believe it or not, people used to have 
to go outside.  That's called a <i>hat</i>.

5
00:00:26,334 --> 00:00:27,630
Outside? A <i>hat</i>?

6
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:31,882
Yes, outside on the earth's surface, not inside these 
bitchun buildings, in the daylight...

7
00:00:31,966 --> 00:00:33,966
A <i>hat</i> is a helmet to protect you from the cold...

8
00:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,889
I'm finishing writing my history of the 21st century right now.

9
00:00:38,029 --> 00:00:40,624
Do you know how I learned so much about 
how our Bitchun Society was formed?

10
00:00:40,693 --> 00:00:41,290
No.

11
00:00:41,388 --> 00:00:44,514
Well, little one, let me tell you.

12
00:00:45,014 --> 00:00:47,888
The founders of our Bitchun Society kept immaculate 
records in The Internet Archive.

13
00:00:47,984 --> 00:00:51,070
What's The Internet Archive?

14
00:00:51,158 --> 00:00:54,152
Everything's recorded now, was it different then? 

15
00:00:54,652 --> 00:00:56,652
Very different...

16
00:00:57,152 --> 00:00:58,222
Corporations...

17
00:00:58,722 --> 00:01:02,496
Corporations owned the voices of the people 
before the Founders found The Archive.

18
00:01:02,798 --> 00:01:06,043
Many voices have been lost.  

19
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:10,316
What do you mean, many voices were lost, great grandfather?

20
00:01:10,565 --> 00:01:13,184
If someone didn't license their work 
using Creative Commons licenses,

21
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:15,684
and upload it to The Internet Archive,

22
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:18,657
it wasn't free for individuals to share, 
it belonged to a corporation.

23
00:01:18,734 --> 00:01:21,985
Those who used The Archive and Creative Commons 
were free to share ideas without corporate control.

24
00:01:22,010 --> 00:01:24,151
Share! Remix! Upload! 
Those voices we can still hear today.

25
00:01:24,208 --> 00:01:26,000
And forever, right?

26
00:01:27,347 --> 00:01:34,815
Have your voice heard forever:
use The Internet Archive
and Creative Commons licenses.
